# Reproducing The Brain_typing Paper

In original paper they have used tensorflow v1 which is outdated and hard to understand what is going on. So I implement the same architecture using Pytorch. 


# Brain_typing (Original README)
Codes, data for brain typing paper.

Converting Your Thoughts to Texts: Enabling Brain Typing via Deep Feature Learning of EEG Signals (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08820.pdf)

brain_typing.py: the python code

emotiv_7sub_5class.mat: the local dataset used in the paper

data_readme: the decription of local dataset

S1_nolabel.mat: an example of 1 subject, which is a subset of Physionet EEG MI database.
